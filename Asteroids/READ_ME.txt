Dear user:

To install our application on your android device, first open the development project in Android studio under a new project.

Next, plug your Android device into your computer USB port. 

Go into the developer settings of your android device (Settings>Developer) and activate USB debugging mode

If you are working with a Mac, you can skip the next step.

Windows machines must install android drivers before exporting to an android device.
a guide for how to install windows android drivers can be found here:

Once your machine detects your android device, simply press the green triangle on the Android Studio toolbar.

You will be prompted to select your device... do so.

Press okay and allow your computer a few moments to compile the code. 

You should see the game pop up on your android device's screen.
If you exit the game and open your applications folder, you will find a fresh new copy of Bee Flightened.
